# Platform-Specific Guidelines

## Xiaohongshu (RED)

### Format
- Image-text notes (图文笔记): 3-9 images + text
- Cover image is critical — it determines click-through rate
- Text limit: ~1000 characters visible before "expand"

### Title Formula
```
[Number] + [Pain Point or Benefit] + [Curiosity Gap]
```
Examples:
- "花了3000块踩坑后，我终于发现了问题不在工具上"
- "你每天多花的那2小时，可能根本不是因为你效率低"
- "用了AI之后反而更累？问题出在这一步"

Avoid: superlatives ("最好的"), direct product names in title, clickbait without payoff.

### Body Structure
```
Opening line: Problem-revealing hook (1-2 sentences)
Body: Scenario narration with specific details (3-5 paragraphs)
  - Who + what happened
  - The hidden cost / surprising realization
  - How it was resolved (product appears here, casually)
Key insight: One memorable takeaway (1-2 sentences)
Call to action: Curiosity-driven, NOT sales-driven
  - GOOD: "评论区扣1，我把具体方法发你"
  - BAD: "点击链接注册"
```

### Tags
Use 5-8 tags. Mix broad tags (#AI, #效率提升) with niche tags (#程序员日常, #论文写作).

### Posting Schedule
- Best times: 20:00-22:00 (evening browsing peak)
- Frequency: 3-4 posts per week for consistent growth
- Avoid posting during work hours (low engagement for most niches)

## Douyin (TikTok CN)

### Format
- Vertical video, 9:16 ratio
- Optimal length: 30-60 seconds (prioritize completion rate)
- Subtitles are mandatory — many users watch on mute

### Script Structure (Problem-First)
```
[0-3s] Hook: Counterintuitive statement or surprising number
       Must create "wait, what?" reaction

[3-20s] Problem Reveal: Show the scenario
        Use screen recording, day-in-life footage, or side-by-side comparison
        The viewer should think "that's me" or "I never noticed that"

[20-40s] Solution in Action: Show the workflow change
         Product appears naturally as part of the new workflow
         Focus on the PROCESS, not the tool name

[40-50s] Result: Show the concrete outcome
         Specific numbers or before/after comparison

[50-60s] Close: End with the story, not a sales pitch
         "关注我，下次教你XX" or open a curiosity loop for next video
```

### Key Metrics to Optimize
- **Completion rate > 30%**: Most important — the hook determines this
- **Comment rate > 2%**: Ask implicit questions ("你们有没有这种情况？")
- **Share rate**: Counterintuitive or "I didn't know that" content gets shared

### Posting Schedule
- Best times: 12:00-13:00 (lunch break), 19:00-21:00 (evening)
- Frequency: 3-5 videos per week
- First 2 hours after posting determine algorithmic push

### Video Types Ranked by Virality Potential
1. "I never realized I was doing this wrong" (counterintuitive revelation)
2. Side-by-side comparison (two approaches, one clearly better)
3. "One change that fixed everything" (single actionable insight)
4. Screen recording with voiceover (showing real workflow)

## WeChat Official Account (公众号)

### Format
- Long-form articles, 1500-3000 characters
- More depth than Xiaohongshu, more text than Douyin
- Readers expect complete, well-structured arguments

### Article Structure
```
Title: Problem-framed question or counterintuitive statement
Opening paragraph: Scenario that reveals the problem (200 chars)
Section 1: Why this problem exists and why most people miss it
Section 2: What the hidden costs are (with specific examples)
Section 3: The approach that works (product woven into narrative)
Closing: One actionable takeaway the reader can use TODAY
```

### Trust-Building Approach
WeChat readers are more skeptical and detail-oriented. Micro-details matter even more:
- Specific numbers with sources
- Named scenarios (anonymized but specific)
- "I tried X, it didn't work. Then I tried Y" narrative honesty

---

## Zhihu (知乎)

### Format
- Answer questions or write articles (专栏)
- Readers expect expertise and depth
- Best for reaching technical and professional audiences

### Approach
- Find existing questions that match your problem-first angle
- Structure answers as: "Most answers here focus on X, but the real issue is Y"
- Use data, comparisons, and logical reasoning
- Product mentions should be in a "by the way" or "what I personally use" style
- Avoid any hint of promotional intent — Zhihu users are highly ad-averse
