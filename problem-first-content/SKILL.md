description: "Problem-first content marketing methodology for social media (Xiaohongshu/RED, Douyin/TikTok, WeChat, Zhihu, etc.). Use when the user wants to write marketing copy, social media posts, short video scripts, product promotion content, or any customer-acquisition content. Also use when the user mentions 'write a post for Xiaohongshu', 'Douyin script', 'social media content', 'marketing copy', 'content marketing', 'customer acquisition content', 'promotional content', 'product promotion', or wants to create content that drives user engagement and conversion. Core principle: effective content makes users discover their own problems first, then presents the product as a natural solution within a scenario — never leads with product features."

# Problem-First Content Marketing

## Core Methodology

Effective customer-acquisition content follows one principle: **make users discover their own problems first, then present the product as the natural solution within a concrete scenario.**

Most content fails because it tries to prove "how good the product is." Users scroll past this because they don't yet believe they have a problem. The fix is simple: reverse the order.

```
WRONG: Product features → Why it's good → Call to action
RIGHT: Problem the user doesn't know they have → Scenario showing the cost → Solution appears naturally
```

## The Five Rules

Apply these five rules to every piece of content. Violating any one significantly reduces conversion.

### Rule 1: Problem Before Product

Content must first make users aware that a problem exists. Users don't buy products — they buy solutions to problems they've recognized.

- BAD: "Our translation tool supports 50 languages with 99% accuracy"
- GOOD: "Your bilingual contract got rejected by the client's lawyer — not because the translator was bad, but because no one caught the 3 terminology errors"

### Rule 2: Scenario Over Features

Users buy the scenario, not the product. A pain point without a scenario cannot move users to action.

- BAD: "AI can help you write papers faster"
- GOOD: "My roommate used ChatGPT to write a literature review. Plagiarism check: 30%. She revised it three times. It went up to 35%."

The scenario makes the problem tangible and relatable. The user sees themselves in it.

### Rule 3: Novel Angle in First 3 Seconds

The first 3 seconds (or first line) must create a feeling of "I never thought about it that way." Avoid high-certainty, hard-sell openings.

- BAD: "Best AI tool of 2026, a must-have!" (hard sell, user scrolls past)
- GOOD: "Why did your work actually increase after you started using AI?" (counterintuitive, user stops to think)

Effective openers use: counterintuitive claims, specific numbers with unexpected conclusions, relatable micro-moments, or questions that challenge assumptions.

### Rule 4: Micro-Detail Trust

A single micro-level action builds more trust than any macro-level display. A woodworker checking a board's surface with his fingertips is more convincing than a tour of his factory.

- BAD: Show your platform dashboard, user count, uptime stats
- GOOD: Show two AI translations side-by-side with red annotations highlighting the 3 spots where they disagree — the user sees the verification process

Trust comes from showing *how things are done*, not *how big you are*.

### Rule 5: Product as Background, Not Foreground

The product should appear naturally within the scenario, mentioned in passing — never formally introduced.

- BAD: "Here I'm using XX Platform, which supports unified API access to multiple models..."
- GOOD: "I usually call both models through the same interface — switching between them is like switching browser tabs"

If the user wants to know more, they'll ask. The content's job is to make them curious, not to close the sale.

## Content Creation Workflow

### Step 1: Identify the Hidden Problem

Find problems users have but haven't articulated. Sources:

- Competitor product reviews (especially 2-3 star reviews — specific complaints)
- Community discussions (forums, comment sections, Q&A sites)
- Personal experience and observation of target users' daily workflows
- The gap between what users think their problem is vs. what it actually is

Ask: "What is my target user doing right now that's wasting their time/money, but they don't realize it?"

### Step 2: Build the Scenario

Construct a specific, relatable scenario around the problem:

- **Who**: A specific person (my friend, my colleague, a student I know)
- **What happened**: A concrete incident with specific details
- **The hidden cost**: Quantify what the problem is costing them (time, money, opportunities)
- **The realization moment**: When they (or the narrator) noticed the real issue

### Step 3: Design the Solution Appearance

The solution (your product) enters the scenario as:

- What the person in the story switched to
- A casual mention of how the narrator does it differently
- A detail the audience notices and asks about in comments

Never: "And that's why I recommend XX product."
Instead: "After that, they changed one thing in their workflow..." (product is part of that one thing)

### Step 4: Craft the Opening Hook

Write the first 3 seconds / first line LAST, after the full content is drafted. Choose from:

| Hook Type | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| Counterintuitive | "The more AI tools you use, the less efficient you become" |
| Specific number + surprise | "47 window switches in one hour — I recorded my colleague's screen" |
| Relatable micro-moment | "That 2-second hesitation when you have 4 apps open and can't remember which one to paste into" |
| Challenge assumption | "You think you're saving time with AI. Your boss thinks so too. That's the problem." |

### Step 5: Self-Check Before Publishing

Run every piece of content through this checklist:

```
1. Does the user feel "that's a new angle" in the first 3 seconds?     → Novelty
2. Does the content help users discover a problem, or prove I'm great? → Problem-first
3. Is there a specific person in a specific scenario?                   → Scenario value
4. Is there one credible micro-detail?                                  → Detail trust
5. Does the product appear "in passing" or "on a stage"?                → Soft placement
```

**If #2 fails → rewrite the entire piece.** This is the most common and most costly mistake.

## Platform-Specific Adaptation

See [references/platforms.md](references/platforms.md) for detailed formatting, structure, and style guidelines for each platform (Xiaohongshu, Douyin, WeChat, Zhihu, etc.).

## Content Templates

See [references/templates.md](references/templates.md) for ready-to-use content templates organized by user segment (developers, students, business users, general consumers) with fill-in-the-blank structures.

## Anti-Patterns

Common mistakes that make content feel like an ad:

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Leading with product name | User has no context for why they should care | Lead with the problem scenario |
| Listing features | Features mean nothing without a felt problem | Show the cost of NOT having the feature |
| "Best tool of 2026" | Zero credibility, maximum ad-feeling | Show one specific micro-result |
| Screenshot of your dashboard | Proves nothing to the user | Show the user's workflow before/after |
| "10,000 users trust us" | Social proof without scenario is noise | "My friend tried it and..." is stronger |
| Ending with "link in bio" | Breaks the story, reveals the ad | End with the story's resolution; let curiosity drive action |
